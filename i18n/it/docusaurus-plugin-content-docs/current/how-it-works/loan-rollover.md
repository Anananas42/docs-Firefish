Loan rollover allows you to extend your loan term instead of repaying at maturity, providing flexibility when you need more time or want to continue leveraging your Bitcoin position.

## Benefits of Loan Rollover

- Extend loan duration without full repayment
- Maintain your Bitcoin position longer
- Avoid immediate liquidity requirements
- Potentially negotiate new terms

## How to Rollover Your Loan

1. Review your upcoming loan maturity
2. Access the "Loan actions" menu before maturity
3. Select "Request rollover"
4. Review and potentially negotiate new terms
5. Wait for investor approval
6. Confirm the rollover agreement
7. Pay any applicable rollover fees

:::warning Important
Rollover requests should be made well before your loan maturity date to ensure sufficient time for investor approval
