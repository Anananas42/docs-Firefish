(b)	It is in our sole and absolute discretion (i) whether we match or do not match any of the submitted Borrowing interests with any of the submitted Lending interests, (ii) to determine the criteria, including any automatic processes or tools, according to which any of the submitted Borrowing interests and any of any of the submitted Lending interests will be matched, and (iii) to determine any process aimed at finding a match we deem suitable ‚Äì we may, for example, present one or multiple Firefish Invest users that have submitted a Lending interest with one or more Borrowing interests (whereby, in general, first to confirm rule will apply).

(c)	Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that due to the specifics of Bitcoin secured loan, notably security provided by the Borrower in a form of Bitcoin collateral and Bitcoin collateral escrow thereof, we have no duty whatsoever to consider in our matching any aspects or factors pertaining to the person of Lender or Borrower (e.g. counterparty risk).

(d)	We may insert any of the Borrowing interest into the list of available Borrowing interests and make such listing available in the Firefish App for Firefish Invest users to pick a suitable match themselves.

Please be advised that Loan details as shown to you may in some instances differ from the Interest you have submitted or confirmed as acceptable (and we do not represent that the two will be the same). Therefore you agree to review and check all the Loan details carefully before eventually confirming them.

(b)	You may also be shown and prompted to confirm information about your bank account to be used with regards to or in connection with respective Bitcoin secured loan (the ‚ÄúAccount details‚Äù). Please be advised that Account details shown to you will be based on information about your bank account registered with us (Article 6.7). In any case, you agree to review and check the Account details carefully before eventually confirming them; should you encounter any issues with the Account details as shown to you, you will most probably have to appropriately alter the information about your bank account registered with us (Article 6.7) through your Firefish account section before eventually proceeding any further.

(c)	We will identify your Bitcoin secured loan counterparty to you by their Unique identifier. Except where forming part of their payment coordinates, you will not be shown personal data of your Bitcoin secured loan counterparty. You may ask for relevant legal identification details of your counterparty. You acknowledge and agree that we will provide you with such identification details, and provide your Bitcoin secured loan counterparty with such details on you (and/or your Company) upon request that we deem substantiated, notably when provision of details sought is necessary or advisable  for enforcement or protection of the requesting party's rights.

(d)	Without prejudice to other legal effects thereof, notably as stipulated in these Terms, by confirming the Loan details through the Firefish App you (or your Company, if the Firefish account is registered for a Company) will firmly and irrevocably consent with entering into the Loan and security agreement (as defined below).

**7.5**   **Loan and security agreement**

(c)	If there are any conflicts between these Terms and the Loan and security agreement, the Loan and security agreement shall prevail.

(d)	Firefish believes that transaction under Loan and security agreement, mainly due to its structure, shall not according to applicable law thereto be subject to consumer credit (civil) norms irrespective of eventual consumer/trader status of any party to the transaction.

(e)	The Loan agreement contains legally binding contracts. However, we do not represent nor guarantee that your Loan agreement or any term or condition thereof may not be found invalid, ineffective or unenforceable by any competent judicial or other authority and we shall bear no liability should it be the case. We also do not represent nor guarantee that our belief under the preceding Clause (7.5(d)) is necessarily correct or that it will be shared by competent authorities and you expressly agree that you will not rely on anything of the aforementioned to be the case. YOU SHOULD READ ALL THE LOAN DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY AND CONSULT WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.

(f)	You can access your Loan and security agreement document through Firefish App. In order to enhance your documentary security you may consider making a copy (downloading) of your Loan and security agreement onto your device.

(c)	Firefish Borrow users must be willing and able to transfer Bitcoin collateral from, and receive Bitcoin collateral on, their Bitcoin blockchain address. Firefish Invest users must be willing to accept Bitcoin collateral as in-kind repayment of their Bitcoin secured loan (however, such Bitcoin may then be exchanged for fiat money - please see Chapter 12. on our Liquidation exchange service).

(d)	Firefish Invest users that decide to self-liquidate (Article 12.2 below) must be also able to receive Bitcoin collateral on their Bitcoin blockchain address. If this is your case, with regardst to every self-liquidated Bitcoin secured loan you will be asked to provide your Bitcoin blockchain address.

(a)	If you are a Firefish Borrow user, as a part of the Escrow setup support we will guide you through, and may provide you with certain technical support (such as the dedicated software tool to be compiled and run by on your own hardware and able to construct complex addresses and transactions) for, or other assistance in the course of, the process of setting-up or extending (in case of collateral top-up) the technical and transactional environment created on Bitcoin blockchain consisting of the collateral holding addresses and partially or wholly pre-signed transactions, as stipulated by the Applicable escrow rules (the ‚ÄúEscrow environment‚Äù), including pre-signing of certain transactions as previewed by the Applicable escrow rules. Brief description of such process may be found on the Site; we reserve the right to modify or otherwise alter any description(s) thereof from time to time without notice.

(c)	Although we may provide you with technical support or guidance, it is your sole responsibility to duly ascertain, by any means you deem necessary, whether the actual escrow environment in place is in full conformity with your Loan and security agreement. You acknowledge and agree that (i) if you are a Firefish Borrow user, you shall send no Bitcoin into the escrow environment unless you completely agree with its nature, including how it has been set, or that (ii) if you are a Firefish Invest user, you shall not disburse any money to the respective Borrower under your Loan and security agreement unless you verified that collateral has been placed in the Escrow environment as required by your Loan and security agreement.

(b)	We agree to Fee bump any Escrow environment transaction relating to your Bitcoin secured loan by additional Bitcoin amount as we deem necessary, up to the amount of Processing fee we had received in connection with such a loan. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall we be obligated or have any other duty whatsoever to make a Fee bump in excess of the Processing fee amount actually received by us.

(c)	Should the amount of Fee bump necessary to promptly mine an Escrow environment transaction be greater than Processing fee we had received, we will in general contact the party or parties concerned and try to resolve the issue (most notably by us receiving from the party or parties concerned the remaining part of Fee bump funding) so that the transaction effectively be mined as soon as possible. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we shall be fully released from any obligations or other duties with respect to Fee bumping by Fee bumping such transaction with Bitcoin in the amount of Processing fee we had received and shall incur no liability in contract or in law to you or any party whomsoever for, or in connection with, such action (including not acting otherwise).

**11.**   **DISTRIBUTION ESCROW**   

**11.1**   **Use cases**   

(a)	Save for its return to respective Borrower following the ordinary repayment of Bitcoin secured loan, Bitcoin from any Escrow environment will be sent to, and shall be distributed to respective beneficiary party(ies) through the use of, another specifically designed escrow-type mechanism (the ‚ÄúDistribution escrow‚Äù).

(b)	If you are a Liquidation exchange service (as defined in Article 12.1 below) user, the Distribution escrow in place will also serve as a tool aiming at facilitating the secure settlement of your Liquidation exchange agreement (as defined in Clause 12.3(a) hereof).

(c)	Distribution escrow forms an integral part of your Bitcoin secured loan design and as such shall be mandatory.

(d)	For the avoidance of doubt, although the Distribution escrow mechanism will be arranged for and deployed in connection with every Bitcoin secured loan, it shall only come into real use if the respective Bitcoin secured loan has been, according to your Loan and security agreement, repaid by Bitcoin collateral.

**11.2**   **Governing rules**   

(a)    Your Distribution escrow will be governed by the Distribution escrow rules that will be published at the moment of your confirmation of Loan details (Clause 7.4(d) above) on our Site [here](https://app.firefish.io/pdf/distribution-escrow-rules.pdf) (the ‚ÄúApplicable distribution escrow rules‚Äù).

(b)	In connection with every Bitcoin collateral escrow we will also provide you with the Distribution escrow strictly according to Applicable distribution escrow rules.

(c)	Distribution escrow will be handled by our nominated agent (the ‚ÄúEscrow agent‚Äù) as identified under the definition of ‚ÄúEscrow agent‚Äù in the Applicable distribution escrow rules. Please refer to your Applicable distribution escrow rules for more information about how our relations with the Escrow agent in connection with their discharge of duties under the Distribution escrow are regulated.

(c)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the purposes of precedent Clause (11.4(b)) Firefish may, without having any obligation or duty to make an investigation whatsoever, always assume that no payments were made for the satisfaction of the Amount Due owed under your respective Loan and security agreement. We are entitled to act upon such assumption even in case we have obtained, or should have obtained, information (including eventual documents) from any source, including parties or any of the parties to respective Loan and security agreement, which is, or may be reasonably alleged to be, inconsistent therewith.

(d)	With regards to information and data provided for the Distribution escrow Firefish may, for the sake of practicality, apply appropriate mathematical rounding or any other method of rounding as we deem reasonable.

We will not be liable to you due to, by reason of, or otherwise in connection with, our suspension or termination of your right to use your Firefish account, the Site or any other Services.

**20.2**   **You**   

(a)	If you have any concern using the Site or any of the Services, we kindly ask you to first contact us and we will endeavor to resolve any pending issues.

(b)	Your only remedy against us with respect to any dissatisfaction with (i) the Site or the other Services, (ii) any term of these Terms, or (iii) any policy or practice of Firefish in operating the Services, is to terminate your Firefish account and your use of all of the Firefish services. You may terminate your use of the Firefish services and your Firefish account at any time.

**20.3**   **Consumer's right of withdrawal**   

(a)	This Article (20.3) applies to you if, with regards to any of our Services, you qualify as consumer under applicable consumer protection law. 

(b)	You take note that the applicable consumer protection law stipulates that a consumer has the right to withdraw from a contract on provision of services in return for consideration concluded with a trader at distance (=online) without giving reasons within fourteen days, beginning the day after conclusion of the contract. 

(c)	The right to withdraw from a contract does not apply, among others, to contracts concerning (i) the provision of a service, where such provision has commenced with the consumer‚Äôs express consent and the consumer has declared that they have been duly advised of the fact that, by expressing such consent, they lose the right of withdrawal upon complete service provision, and the service has been provided completely; and (ii) the provision of a service for which the price is dependent on price movements on the financial market which cannot be controlled by the trader and which may occur within the withdrawal period.

(d)	You hereby (i) expressly agree that we will start performing agreed relevant Services before the expiration of withdrawal period, and (ii) declare your express request that we shall in every case immediately perform agreed relevant Services. You take note of and acknowledge your loss of the right of withdrawal upon the full performance of such Services.

(e)	If you are a Firefish Borrow user, you acknowledge and agree that (i) all of our Services covered by fees pertaining to your Bitcoin secured loan shall be deemed completely provided to you at latest in the moment when you fund your Escrow environment relevant to this Bitcoin secured loan; and (ii) although our Services may include us entering into certain agreements (most notably the Escrow rules and Distribution escrow rules), our provision of such Services that is covered by fees only consists of us entering into respective agreements and assuming defined roles thereunder;(iii)  being separate multi-party agreements between us, you, and your respective Lender, these legal instruments themselves are not intended to, and in any case shall not, constitute a contract on provision of services by Firefish to you in return for consideration.

(f)	You may withdraw from any other contracts on provision of services in return for consideration (i.e. contracts not previously mentioned) without giving any reason within fourteen days of the conclusion thereof. To exercise such your right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from the contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail) sent to (i) our registered office address as stated in Clause I.(b) hereof, or (ii) hello@firefish.io. You may also choose to use the model withdrawal form available [here](https://app.firefish.io/pdf/model-withdrawal.pdf). It is sufficient for you to send the notification of your exercise of right to withdraw before the expiry of the withdrawal period.   

(g)	If you withdraw from a contract as stated herein, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you under such contract without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from such contract.
