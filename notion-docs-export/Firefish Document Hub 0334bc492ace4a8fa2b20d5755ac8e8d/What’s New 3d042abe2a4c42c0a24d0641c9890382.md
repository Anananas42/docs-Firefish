    **Ethereum-based USDC** (Circle) stablecoin loans are now available on the platform in a Beta mode.
    
    Stablecoin loans are **USD-denominated loans** that are **disbursed and repaid in USDC stablecoins** on a 1:1 basis. 
    
    Please refer to the following link to access the stablecoins FAQ.

    In order to provide a complete borrowing and investing experience involving banking money, Firefish is required to comply with standard KYC/AML regulations. 
    
    On top of that, Firefish aims to ensure security and prevention of fraudulent activities for both Borrowers and Investors in the P2P relationship, while safeguarding the integrity of the platform's transactions and operations.
    
    The identity verification through a KYC process is required to ensure regulatory compliance and secure financial transactions. Our verification partner is [Idenfy](https://idenfy.com).
    
    In order to request loans or invest through the Firefish platform, it is necessary to verify and upgrade your account to the ‚Äò**BASIC‚Äô** tier through the ‚Äò**My account‚Äô** menu.
    
    The short verification (KYC) process consists of the following steps:
    
    - **Identity verification** - this involves standard verification of your ID processed by our partner [Idenfy](https://idenfy.com). You will need to provide a valid ID and take a selfie using your device.
    - **Personal details confirmation** - review and confirm your personal details, or request a correction if any of the details are incorrect.
    - **Phone verification** - receive an SMS on your mobile phone and enter the provided code on the platform to complete the verification process.
    - **Questionnaire** - complete a brief questionnaire required by KYC/AML regulations.
    
    Once you successfully verify your account, you will have access to the full functionality of the platform.
    
- **Account Management**
    
    ![Untitled](What%E2%80%99s%20New%203d042abe2a4c42c0a24d0641c9890382/9e976486-a77e-4827-b03d-c8ac012fac53.png)
    
    The new ‚Äò**My Account‚Äô** menu displays your **personal and banking** **details**. These details will be utilized during the borrowing and/or investing process.
    
    Your personal details will be captured from the profile verification process.
    
    The bank account details for different currencies can be added in the ‚Äò**Your bank accounts‚Äô** section.
    
    NOTE: For CZK, only Czech bank accounts with a local account number can be added. EUR accounts need to contain a valid IBAN number.
    
- **Deal Limits**
    
    ![Untitled](What%E2%80%99s%20New%203d042abe2a4c42c0a24d0641c9890382/Untitled%201.png)
    
    A specific per-user deal limit scheme is applied based on the following Account Tiers:
    
    - **ZERO** - Default tier, no borrowing and lending available
    - **BASIC** - EUR 15.000 or CZK 360.000 per transaction and EUR 30.000 in total, per user, for all active loans
    - **INTERMEDIATE** - EUR 50.000 per month, and up to EUR 150.000 in total per user for all active deals
    - **PRO** - custom limits based on your borrowing or investing needs
    
    The platform would not process deals above the set limits. 
    
    To upgrade to the BASIC or INTERMEDIATE tier, please go to ‚Äò**My Account / Account Tiers‚Äô** and select ‚Äò**Upgrade‚Äô**.
    
    To qualify for an INTERMEDIATE tier, you need to upgrade to the BASIC tier first.
    
    We are working on introducing a tier for stablecoin deals.
    
- **Origination Fee**
    
    ![Untitled](What%E2%80%99s%20New%203d042abe2a4c42c0a24d0641c9890382/c798fe94-80b2-4ac8-9ca1-e489a2510a18.png)
    
    An origination fee of **1.5% of the loan** **amount** is applied to Borrowers.
    
    This fee is automatically calculated and displayed as **‚ÄòOrigination fee‚Äô** when submitting a loan request. 
    
    The fee is automatically deducted from the Bitcoin collateral during the collateral locking process phase.
    
- **Liquidations**
    
    
    ![Untitled](What%E2%80%99s%20New%203d042abe2a4c42c0a24d0641c9890382/Untitled%202.png)
    
    Liquidation is a protective process designed to safeguard investors in two scenarios:
    
    - **Default** - ****where the Borrower fails to repay their loan
    - **Price liquidation** - triggered if the Bitcoin price falls to a ‚Äò**Liquidation price‚Äô** level set for each deal. The threshold for price liquidation is set at 95% of the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, calculated as the notional amount plus interest, compared to the actual value of the Bitcoin collateral.
    
    There are two types of liquidation methods available for Investors:
    
    - **Self-liquidation -** Investors receive Bitcoin collateral to their designated liquidation address, which they set during the deal setup process.
    - **üÜï Firefish liquidation** - Firefish manages the collateral liquidation process on behalf of the Investors, and Investors receive their investment back in bank currency. Firefish receives the collateral only once the Investor is fully repaid. This mode allows Investors not to worry about handling cryptographic material, such as private keys or about interacting with exchanges.
    
     
    
    **‚ùóÔ∏èIMPORTANT**:
    
    - **Firefish liquidation** is set as the **default option**. If you prefer self-liquidation for each deal instead, please navigate to ‚Äò**My Account / Settings‚Äô** and enable the ‚Äò**Self-liquidation‚Äô** option. When confirming your investment you will be prompted to provide your Bitcoin liquidation address. Alternatively, you can switch back to Firefish liquidation when confirming the deal.
    - It is possible to have different methods applied for individual deals. To select your preferred option, please toggle the ‚Äò**Self-Liquidation‚Äô** radio button in ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô.
    - It is **not** possible to change the liquidation method for live deals and deals that are in or past the Bitcoin collateral locking process stage.
- **Borrowing**
    
    ![Instant.png](What%E2%80%99s%20New%203d042abe2a4c42c0a24d0641c9890382/568fd9ff-bcc2-439b-9a7a-929dedbb1aa3.png)
    
    To create a new loan request, please navigate to the ‚Äò**Borrow‚Äô** menu and select the ‚Äò**Request a loan‚Äô** button. 
    
    Two types of loans are available:
    
    - **Standard Loan**: Your loan request is posted in the marketplace and sent to relevant investors for matching.
    - **Instant Loan**: Borrow cash immediately at a fixed rate, without the need to wait for an investor match.
    
    If you chose a **Standard Loan**, fill the loan request form with the loan amount, currency, loan period and preferred interest rate parameters. Once you are matched with an investor, you will receive a notification and be guided through the Bitcoin collateral locking process.
    
    For an **Instant Loan**, choose the amount and loan period, and the interest rate will be set automatically. The deal execution is guaranteed. You will immediately proceed to locking your Bitcoin, and once completed, the funds will be instantly sent to your bank account.
    
    The ‚Äò**Loan request summary‚Äô** provides details of the amount due, Bitcoin collateral information, as well as expected service and blockchain network fees. 
    
    You can access your **active** loans under the ‚Äò**My loans‚Äô** tab.
    
- **Investing**
    
    ![image.png](What%E2%80%99s%20New%203d042abe2a4c42c0a24d0641c9890382/image%202.png)
    
    For Investors, there are two new methods of interacting with the platform:
    
    - **Loan Marketplace** - displays all available deals that haven‚Äôt been matched with a particular investor. Investors can select any of the available deals and accept the opportunity.
        
        Once the opportunity is accepted, the investor confirms the details, and the deal is then passed to the Borrower for them to lock their Bitcoin collateral.
        
    - **Watchdog** - an email notification service that enables Investors to receive investment opportunities directly to their inbox. Watchdog allows Investors to customize their preferences for currencies, minimum and maximum loan amounts, interest rates, and loan periods.
        
        Watchdogs can be created or deleted under ‚Äò**Invest** / **My Watchdogs‚Äô** menu. 
        
    
    You can access your **active** investments under the ‚Äò**My investments‚Äô** tab.
    
- **Affiliates**

    **Affiliate Program** enables you to earn bitcoin when referring a friend. You‚Äôll earn a commission of all the amount borrower or investor will make the first year after registration. This 0.5 % commission will be paid to you in bitcoin.
    
    - Earn 0.5 % of the amount referred users will¬†**borrow**¬†or¬†**invest**¬†on the platform in the first year after registration
    - Borrowers get 30 % off the origination fee to their first loan.
    
- **Additional Enhancements**
    - **Preferred Interest Rate** - Borrowers have now the ability to set their preferred interest rate (p.a.) during the loan request process. We strongly recommend to check the ‚Äò**Recent Deals‚Äô** segment on the Home Page to see the most recent interest rates and to increase the probability of a match.
    - **Loan Tenors** - a new, **18** **months** option is available when submitting a loan request.
