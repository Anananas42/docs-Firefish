# Receiving Loans FAQ

### When will I receive funds from the Investor?

The time it takes for you to receive your funds depends on when the investor made the bank transfer and the speed of transaction processing. Typically, you should receive your funds no later than the loan's start date.

For EUR SEPA and local CZK payments, the transfers usually take from intraday to 1-2 days.

SWIFT payments might take a bit longer, possibly a few more days.

Stablecoin (USDC) transactions are settled in real-time.

### What if I never receive funds from the Investor?

Firefish would start a resolution procedure as defined in the [Escrow rules](https://assets.super.so/7ce03212-1a0b-4440-8fd6-50d4268e76ad/files/34d881df-d023-4c31-a3fe-9407dbebb5cd.pdf). If the resolution process ultimately confirms that you never received the funds, your Bitcoin will be unlocked and returned to you.

### What if the Investor doesn't complete their part of the process?

We would cancel the deal and try to match you with a different investor as soon as possible, or list your request in the Marketplace.
